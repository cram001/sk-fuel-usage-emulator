# fuel-usage-calculator
 A signalk plugin that calculates fuel uage from `propulsion.*.fuel.rate`
 The plugin is designed to calculate fuel consumption based on your fuel rate. It determines the instant fuel usage between value updates by using the time difference and the fuel.rate. The plugin accumulates trip, season and total fuel values. It also tracks estimated tank remaining volume when the user enters tank volume and refuelling on the WebAps page.
 
## Config Parameters

### Paths to use for fuel calculations
the paths you want to use to calculate the fuel consumption from. it should be in the propulsion.<RegExp>.fuel.rate
```['propulsion.port.fuel.rate','propulsion.starboard.fuel.rate']```

### How often to save the fuel used to disk
This is how often the fuel used will be saved to a file. If the plugin or signalk is stopped this is the fuel.used value the plugin will start from
```15000```

### Requirements:

NMEA fuel rate ??? sent at least x times / second
??
??

### Compatibility
B&G/Navico / Lowrence Chart plotters should recognize the accumulated values and display them.
Note that the Navico refuel and reset commands are not yet supported.

### TimeOut 
The Timeout setting in the node's configuration, should be set to at least the maximum interval between successive readings. This is to avoid the situation where for example, a sensor is taken off line, develops a fault or there is a communication problem, resulting in a break of several hours between readings and the calculation - interval x fuel.rate = fuel.used would then be inaccurate.

```10000```
